# Joomla Language pack for Scottish Gaelic

This language pack was made by translation of the Joomla 5 English language pack using openai.com. The package can be installed as for any other extension, not as a language. The direct link for download is:

After installation, enable via System -> Content Languages, and then create a Menu and Menu item for the language.
